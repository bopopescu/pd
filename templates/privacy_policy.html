        the Playdation.com website and related distributed or mobile applications (each and collectively the “Website”).</p>
      <p>We have established this
Privacy Policy to provide information regarding the collection and

<UL>
  <LI>your “basic information” you have shared with everyone on the SNS</li>

our Website to access your information on a SNS.</p>
<p>
Additionally, Playdation asks you for certain information about you and your family and friends in the course of using our Website that you enter separately 
including names, gender, zip code, email address, telephone numbers, dates of birth, schools, photos, interests and other such information. You may also provide personal

Playdation uses cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on Users' hard drives. Our cookies are not linked to your personal information.  Playdation uses both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Website and expire when the User closes his or her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Website easier for returning Users by remembering a User's login information. Persistent cookies stay on a User's hard drive from one session to the next. You may choose not to receive cookies from Playdation by following instructions in your web browser's "help" file, but this may make certain features of the Website inaccessible to you.

<p>
Playdation also collects Users' IP addresses and basic log file information (such as address, browser type and language, number of clicks, domain names of web sites visited, pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time) to help locate potential problems with our servers, and to aggregate general user statistics including demographic and geographical information. We use this information to analyze general usage patterns, and to provide advertisements and other services appropriate to the User's location. Playdation may aggregate User information in a non-personally identifiable manner to share with advertisers and to enhance the Website with new features.

<h3>Advertising:</h3>
<p>We partner with third party ad networks to either display or manage advertising on our Website.  Our ad network partners use cookies, web beacons, javascript, or other tracking technologies to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites and applications to provide you targeted advertising based upon your gender, family status, interests, and other criteria.  They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. </p>
<p>Playdation does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This data is only shared in the aggregate. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Playdation to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Playdation Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.</p>
